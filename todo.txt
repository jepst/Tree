latest
	better installer
	shortcut keys: ctrl+1,2,3,4,5,6,7 for formatting
	ctrl-shift-i and ctrl-i both add new node
	arrows in svg
	smarter trace arrows
todo
	add icons, improve installer text (license, how to run, maybe autorun button)
	figure out how to add high color icons?

Vincent's suggestions:
	Allow an easy high-resolution export mode. Currently one needs to set the View to one thousand percent, then export, in order to make high-resolution, large images
	Smarter or adjustable trajectories of traces
	Consider triangles to be part of the lower layer. That is, triangle should be an option BETWEEN a parent and a (single) child node, rather than an option ON a single node.
	
via beta testers
	insert two nodes at a time (no)
	insert sister button (probably not)
	save user preferences (maybe)
	stay on top (no)

serious bugs
	when scanning tree to see how deep trace should drop, maybe we should look at BranchDimensions.Height instead of altitude, if BranchDimensions has been calculated by that point
	reconsider how traces are VERTICALLY spaced: associate with level of horizontal rather than with least common ancestor
	let user manually customize position/size of traces?
	recognize different kinds of arrows, somehow
	avoid firing two TreeSelection events when adding a node: once in UpdateTreeData, once in SelectByNode
	maybe draw ALL tree text before decorations/traces so that corners of text items don't cut off lines; it may be good to modify PaintElement to control the order that such things are drawn; or draw with transparency from bmp via System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageAttributes
	WHY AM I LOSING CHARACTERS WHEN I ITALICIZE!!!! it seems to need a non-italic printing character a the end of each string. Oy. Tab works, even if it's italic


optimization
	Do less comprehensive update on DoCreateTrace; in fact, search for all UpdateEverything and decide if it can be Partial-ized
	find a way to avoid recreatine Elem hierarchy when node is added or removed? A ReCreatePartial(Elem) method should call ScanWorker on its children; in any case, all traces must be updated
	fixup sloppy Walker code, where noted
	re-implement m_selected, possibly as an RTree. We could speed up Contains a lot just by sorting or hashing. also we should make an RTree of all tree elements so we can do hit-testing efficiently



gui tweaks
	collapse branches into triangles?
	possibly default to round endcaps?
	show RTB highlight even when not focussed?
	add dropdown menu interface for traces
	rathar than UpdateEverything(true) after every keypress, set a timer, and only update after a second w/o a keypress
	move to nearby node on delete
	this.DoubleBuffered=true?
	group deletes
	maximizing the window causes the text in zoomToolStripComboBox to get selected
	set SyntaxTree hierarchy to fire events when modified?
	consider kicking off slow tasks (primarily full redraws, GetBitmap) to a worker thread and showing a progress bar in the UI; alternatively, only draw elements that appear in the update region on each OnPaint (see PaintEventARgs.ClipRect; another alternatively, find a way to call StdCalc early, and not every OnPaint
	can RichTextBox2.FormatRange be made more efficient by calling SendMessage without allocating CoTask memory?
	fix rtf parser to skip code marked by \bin tag
	fix UpdateTreeData so as to not lose m_selected
	??group format operations apply to LexicalText iff EVERY SELECTED ITEM has lexical text;  color/font operations apply to lex if lex exists
	richedit research: prevent paste of non-text
	autoscroll to newly created node
	proper rtf->xml/html converter for improved SVG output
	self-sign certificate



new features, version 2.0
	an option to drop all lexical items to bottom of tree, possibly like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cgisf-tgg.svg
	edit indivual lines betweennodes
	drop RichEditBox dependency: display and store formatted text manually
	movie playback
